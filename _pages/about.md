<strong>About Me</strong>: I am a senior data scientist in Walmart Inc. Previously, I got my Ph.D.  from the EECS department at  <a href="https://www.uark.edu">University of Arkansas</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.csce.uark.edu/~lz006/">Prof. Lu Zhang</a>. And I obtained my M.S. and B.ENG. from the college of computer at <a href="https://en.scu.edu.cn">Sichuan University</a> in China.

<strong>Research Interest</strong>: Currently, I have been working on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for LLMs. During my PhD, my research primarily focused on fair machine learning and causal inference. Specifically, I proposed various fairness algorithms to achieve long-term fairness in sequential decision-making. My interests also include generative models, reinforcement learning, natural language processing.
<!--Now I am looking for an internship or a full-time job. If you can provide any information, please feel free to contact me. -->
